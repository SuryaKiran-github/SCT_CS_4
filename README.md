Install the pynput library: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Create a Python Script: Create a new Python file, for example, keylogger.py, and paste the following code into it:

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your script is saved and run the script with:

The script will start capturing keystrokes and saving them to keylog.txt in the same directory as the script. The keylogger will stop when you press the esc key.

Notes: Running as Administrator: On some operating systems, you might need to run your script as an administrator for it to capture keystrokes properly. Ethical Considerations: Only use this script on your own devices or with explicit permission. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical.

Testing and Stopping the Keylogger: To stop the keylogger, press the esc key. Check the keylog.txt file to see the captured keystrokes.
